# Consortial View of Requesting

## Report Details

Brief description: This report provides numbers of filled requests between institutions across the consortium.

NOTE: The display format does not match the SME mockup, but will display as desired if using the [ReShare Reports Portal](https://github.com/indexdata/reshare-reports-portal).

The consortial_requester.sql file will generate data in the following format:

|requester|supplier|count\_of\_requests|
|------------|------------|------------|
|reshare_east|RESHARE:US-WEST|10|
|reshare_east|RESHARE:US-SOUTH|4|
|reshare_west|RESHARE:US-EAST|2|


The consortial_total_by_requester.sql file will generate data in the following format:

|requester|count\_of\_requests|
|------------|------------|
|reshare_east|14|
|reshare_west|2|
